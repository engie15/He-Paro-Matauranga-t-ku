- Imera: desi@datawarriorslab.org

- Tribal sovereignty is only as strong as we exercise it!
  - The more we exercise it, the stronger it gets, the stronger it gets the more we exercise it.

Hautoto, Hautoto
Ka tu heke ana, ka rongo heke ana ko te ngahau o tu
Utaina taku kawa nei he kawa tua maunga, ka wiwini, ka wawana, Tara patatu ki te rangi aue ki!
Whano, Whana, Haramai te toki haumie, hui e
Taiki e!
He karakia na te tohunga a Rangi-tu-roua i tā tenei karakia ki runga ia Horouta Waka. Hei arahi tōtika te waka ki tona ūnga ki tua whenua.
I taki au i tenei karakia hei arahi tōtika i ahau, hakoa aupiki, hakoa auheke o Te Kaunihera Kia tae pai atu ki taku ūnga, ara hei reo maori, hei kanohi maori, kia hua ko nga Iwi, nga whanau, me nga hapori o Te Tairawhiti ki te teepu o Te Kaunihera!
Hui e! Taiki e!
Kaiwhakaahua Zoe Te Kani

When you spoke on the epitome of harm, having the courage to hold people / organisations to account is scary and can put ourselves and our whānau in harms way (physically / socially / mentally), do you have pragmatic advice for us to help stand up?

what can I do in 10 years?
Obselete, see myself as expired and out!
Hold a mirror up to ourselves, whānau and communities - we have to call out the shit and we have to be the change.
Doing this in our own communities.
